## Brainstorming
Things which feel inevitable:
- water rising 
- overwhelming enemies overtaking a fort
- sunrise / sunset
- temperature rising
- ice melting
- getting old / dying
- something decaying
- acid eating away something

Themes
- stretching a resource.  E.g. driving more efficiently because it saves gas
- buying time.  E.g. delaying an enemy so that people can escape a town.
- 

Idea - "don't run out of gas!"
- Side view, you see a car with a profile of a road.  Camera is fixed to the car so as you drive forward the road scrolls right to left.
- Road goes up and down.  You have to decide how much gas (one button press) to use to climb a hill so that you can clear it and coast down.  Try to make it to the next gas station.
- Pros: seems somewhat easy, simple to understand and play
- Cons: where does the scaling lie? what is being "good"? just timing pressing the button or not? do I have to introduce some other mechanic like jumping?  Maybe you upgrade your car between levels?  e.g. choose solar panels which help your car recover energy when it's sunny out

Hex game of life thing.  We doin' that.
